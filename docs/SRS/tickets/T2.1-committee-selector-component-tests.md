# T2.1 CommitteeSelector Component Tests

**Status:** Open
**Roadmap:** [SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](../SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) Testing Tier 2 §T2.1
**Effort:** 1–2 days
**Depends on:** [3.1 Jurisdiction Assignment UI](3.1-jurisdiction-assignment-ui.md) for final scoped behavior

## Summary

Add component/integration tests for `CommitteeSelector` to protect the core committee selection and member-management UX during Tier 2/3 refactors.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Cascade behavior is tested:
  - city/town selection
  - leg-district options update
  - election-district options update
- [ ] Committee member list renders correctly for populated and empty committees.
- [ ] Add-member flow assertions cover role-based branching (admin direct add vs leader request flow).
- [ ] Remove-member trigger path is covered.
- [ ] Empty states are tested:
  - no committees available
  - no members in selected committee
  - no jurisdiction assignments (leader)
- [ ] Loading and async refresh states are covered.

## Implementation Notes

- **File under test:** `apps/frontend/src/app/committees/CommitteeSelector.tsx`
- Prefer integration-style tests with mocked API boundaries over shallow rendering.
