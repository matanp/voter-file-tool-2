# 2.1a Email/Phone During Leader Submission

**Status:** Done
**Roadmap:** [SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](../SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) §2.1a
**Effort:** 0.5–1 day
**Depends on:** [1.2 CommitteeMembership Model](1.2-committee-membership-model.md)

## Summary

Allow leaders (and admins) to provide optional contact information (email and phone) when submitting a committee member. This contact data is stored in `CommitteeMembership.submissionMetadata` — it is never written to `VoterRecord`, since BOE imports overwrite voter record fields. Display logic prefers submitted contact info over voter record when both are present.

## Acceptance Criteria

### API

- [x] `committee/add` request body: accept optional `email: string` and `phone: string` fields
- [x] `committee/requestAdd` request body: accept optional `email: string` and `phone: string` fields
- [x] Zod validation: if `email` provided, must be valid email format; if `phone` provided, no strict format (store as-is for v1)
- [x] Store contact info in `CommitteeMembership.submissionMetadata` as `{ email?: string; phone?: string }`
- [x] **Never** write submitted email/phone to `VoterRecord` — `VoterRecord` is only updated via BOE imports

### Display Logic

- [x] When displaying a committee member's contact info (roster view, member card), use:
  - Email: `submissionMetadata?.email ?? voterRecord.email`
  - Phone: `submissionMetadata?.phone ?? voterRecord.telephone`
- [x] Document this display precedence in a code comment where the display logic is implemented

### UI

- [x] `AddCommitteeForm.tsx`: add optional "Email" and "Phone" input fields below voter selection
- [x] Fields are not required — form submits without them
- [x] Label fields clearly as "Contact info for this submission" or similar to communicate that these are submission-specific overrides

### Validation

- [x] Frontend: client-side email format validation if email field is filled (HTML5 type="email" or Zod)
- [x] Backend: server-side Zod validation on `email` field (format check); phone: store as-is

## Implementation Notes

- **`submissionMetadata`:** declared as `Json?` on `CommitteeMembership` in ticket 1.2; this ticket populates it
- **Why not on VoterRecord:** BOE voter file imports overwrite VoterRecord fields; submitted contact info represents the leader's knowledge at time of submission and must be preserved independently
- **Future reports:** display logic (`submissionMetadata?.email ?? voterRecord.email`) will be reused in report generation for committee rosters
