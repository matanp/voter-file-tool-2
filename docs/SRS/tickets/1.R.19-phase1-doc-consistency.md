# 1.R.19 Phase 1 Doc Consistency (P3)

**Status:** Open
**Priority:** P3 — Low
**Effort:** 0.25 day
**Depends on:** —

## Summary

Align Phase 1 documentation: BRANCH_REVIEW Section 8 vs Section 3.2 (mark README sync bullet as Resolved); COMMITTEE_REQUEST_TYPO_FIX title typo (committList → committeList); PHASE1_CODE_REVIEW_FINDINGS consistency (historical findings wording, Review Outcome, closeout gate).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] In BRANCH_REVIEW Section 8: prepend "Resolved:" to the bullet "Update tickets/README.md so 1.R.1 status matches the ticket file" so it aligns with §3.2.
- [ ] In COMMITTEE_REQUEST_TYPO_FIX: replace "committList" with "committeList" in the document title (and anywhere else in the file).
- [ ] In PHASE1_CODE_REVIEW_FINDINGS: rename the detailed findings section to "Historical Findings (Resolved in Current Branch)" and add a note that P1s are resolved per the table. Change Review Outcome to state Phase 1 is closed by ticket criteria; P1 items fixed; P2 findings (5–6) remain open. Adjust closing gate to past tense or "recommended before Phase 2".
