# 1.1b LTED-to-Assembly-District Mapping

**Status:** Open
**Roadmap:** [SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](../SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) §1.1b
**Effort:** 1–2 days
**Depends on:** Nothing (or 1.1 if term affects crosswalk)

## Summary

Create the `LtedDistrictCrosswalk` model mapping LTED (cityTown, legDistrict, electionDistrict) to Assembly, Senate, Congressional, and local districts. Include migration/seed structure. Admin UI or import path for loading crosswalk data is deferred until [SRS_GAPS_AND_CONSIDERATIONS.md](../SRS_GAPS_AND_CONSIDERATIONS.md) §2.1 (format, source) is resolved — schema and migration can proceed now.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `LtedDistrictCrosswalk` model per SRS §4.2 — LTED-to-district crosswalk table with Assembly, Senate, Congressional, and local districts (see Data Model doc)
- [ ] Migration/seed structure to populate from MCDC-provided data (format TBD; empty table or minimal seed acceptable for v1)
- [ ] Eligibility validation (2.1) will use this for AD hard stop when `requireAssemblyDistrictMatch` is enabled
- [ ] **Deferred:** Admin UI or import path to load/update crosswalk data — implement once Gaps §2.1 (format, source) is resolved

## Implementation Notes

- **Schema:** See [SRS_DATA_MODEL_CHANGES.md](../SRS_DATA_MODEL_CHANGES.md) — LtedDistrictCrosswalk model
- **Fields:** `cityTown`, `legDistrict`, `electionDistrict`, `stateAssemblyDistrict`, `stateSenateDistrict?`, `congressionalDistrict?`, `countyLegDistrict?`
- **Unique:** `@@unique([cityTown, legDistrict, electionDistrict])`
- **Fallback:** If crosswalk data unavailable at go-live, `requireAssemblyDistrictMatch=false` on CommitteeGovernanceConfig allows system to run until data is loaded
