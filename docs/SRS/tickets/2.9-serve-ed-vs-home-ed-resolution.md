# 2.9 Serve ED vs Home ED Resolution

**Status:** Open
**Roadmap:** [SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](../SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) Tier 2 follow-up
**Effort:** 0.5–1 day
**Depends on:** [2.1 Eligibility Validation](2.1-eligibility-validation.md), [3.1 Jurisdiction-Scoped Access](3.1-jurisdiction-assignment-ui.md)

## Summary

Resolve the final partial item in `SRS_GAPS_AND_CONSIDERATIONS` by making an explicit product decision for v1 and codifying enforcement behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Decide one v1 policy and document it in SRS docs:
  - Option A: `Serve ED = Home ED` is enforced.
  - Option B: `Serve ED` may differ and requires explicit data model support.
- [ ] If Option A:
  - document enforcement points (validation/API/UI messaging).
  - ensure docs clearly state this is an intentional v1 rule.
- [ ] If Option B:
  - define minimal schema/API/UI changes required to capture `serveEd`.
  - cut implementation follow-up ticket(s) and link them.
- [ ] Update `SRS_GAPS_AND_CONSIDERATIONS.md` item 5.3 from `Partially Resolved` to a final state (`Resolved` or `Deferred with explicit follow-up`).
