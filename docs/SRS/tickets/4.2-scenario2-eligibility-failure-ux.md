# 4.2 Scenario 2: Eligibility Failure UX + Escalation Messaging

**Status:** Done  
**Priority:** P1  
**Effort:** 1-2 days  
**Depends on:** [4.1 Scenario 1: Leader Submission Preflight + Eligibility Snapshot](4.1-scenario1-leader-submission-preflight.md), [2.1 Eligibility Validation](2.1-eligibility-validation.md)

## Summary

Make failed eligibility submissions clear and actionable for leaders, including criterion-specific reason display and required staff-escalation guidance.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Reason Rendering

- [x] Leader request and add flows render every returned hard-stop reason from API response `reasons[]`.
- [x] Each reason maps to clear user-facing copy via `eligibilityMessages` (or equivalent central mapping).
- [x] If the API response has no structured reasons, the UI falls back to a deterministic generic failure message.

### Escalation Guidance

- [x] For blocked submissions, UI displays: `If you believe this is an exception, contact MCDC staff.`
- [x] Escalation line appears in both modal and toast contexts where submission failure is surfaced.

### Behavior Guardrails

- [x] No membership submission row is created when hard-stop eligibility fails.
- [x] Error state remains visible until user changes input or dismisses manually.

### Tests

- [x] Component tests verify rendering for single and multiple hard-stop reasons.
- [x] Component tests verify escalation guidance appears on blocked submissions.
- [x] API/route test verifies no `CommitteeMembership` row is created on hard-stop failure.
