# 1.3 Membership Type (Petitioned vs. Appointed)

**Status:** Open
**Roadmap:** [SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](../SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) §1.3
**Effort:** 1–2 days
**Depends on:** [1.2 CommitteeMembership Model](1.2-committee-membership-model.md)

## Summary

Wire the `MembershipType` enum (declared in 1.2) into the UI and migration so that every `CommitteeMembership` record carries an accurate `membershipType` value. Existing migrated records are defaulted to `APPOINTED`; the petition workflow (`PETITIONED`) is used when the petition process is implemented.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Migration

- [ ] Update the 1.2 backfill migration (or add a subsequent migration) to set `membershipType=APPOINTED` on all `CommitteeMembership` records that were created from existing `VoterRecord.committeeId` FK data
- [ ] Submitted/pending records backfilled in 1.2 may leave `membershipType` null (appropriate — type resolved at confirmation/activation)

### API

- [ ] `committee/add` (admin direct-add): accept optional `membershipType` in request body; default to `APPOINTED` if omitted
- [ ] `committee/requestAdd` (leader submission): leave `membershipType` null — type is set at activation, not submission

### UI

- [ ] `AddCommitteeForm.tsx`: add optional `membershipType` select field (default `APPOINTED`; options: `APPOINTED`, `PETITIONED`) — shown for admin users only, hidden for leader submission form
- [ ] Display `membershipType` on committee member card/roster view (e.g., badge: "Appointed" / "Petitioned") — read-only

### Validation

- [ ] If `membershipType=PETITIONED` is passed to `committee/add`, still enforce capacity check (PETITIONED members occupy seats just like APPOINTED members in v1)

## Implementation Notes

- **`MembershipType` enum:** declared in 1.2 schema (`PETITIONED`, `APPOINTED`); this ticket ensures it is populated
- **Petition workflow:** `PETITIONED` type is also set during the petition outcome recording workflow (future ticket 2.x); this ticket only covers admin override and UI display
- **Null is valid:** `membershipType` is intentionally nullable on `CommitteeMembership` — null means "pending, not yet determined"
