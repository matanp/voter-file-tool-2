# 3.6 Mobile and Accessibility Baseline for New Admin/Committee UI

**Status:** Open
**Roadmap:** [SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](../SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) Future considerations + Tier 3 quality gate
**Effort:** 0.5–1 day
**Depends on:** [3.1 Jurisdiction Assignment UI](3.1-jurisdiction-assignment-ui.md), [3.5 Audit Trail UI and Export](3.5-audit-trail-ui-export.md)

## Summary

Create and apply a baseline checklist so new UI workflows ship with minimum mobile and accessibility quality before formal audits.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add reusable checklist covering:
  - keyboard/focus behavior
  - ARIA/labels for forms and dialogs
  - error/warning announcement behavior
  - touch target sizing and responsive layout
  - color contrast checks for warning/error states
- [ ] Apply checklist to open Tier 2/3 UI tickets and document pass/fail notes.
- [ ] Ensure unresolved accessibility/mobile issues are explicitly tracked as follow-up tasks.
