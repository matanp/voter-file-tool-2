# T2.3 CommitteeRequestForm and RequestCard Tests

**Status:** Open
**Roadmap:** [SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](../SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) Testing Tier 2 §T2.3
**Effort:** 1 day
**Depends on:** [2.4 Meeting Record + Executive Confirmation Workflow](2.4-meeting-record-confirmation-workflow.md)

## Summary

Add tests for request creation and request review UI components to protect current behavior while the meetings workflow and request handling continue to evolve.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `CommitteeRequestForm` validates required fields and submits expected payload shape.
- [ ] Notes/reason field limits are enforced (max length and empty handling).
- [ ] Replacement/remove request mode switching is covered.
- [ ] `RequestCard` renders request details consistently across statuses.
- [ ] Accept/reject action triggers are tested with expected callbacks and loading states.
- [ ] Error and empty states are covered for unresolved request lists.

## Implementation Notes

- **Files under test:**
  - `apps/frontend/src/app/committees/CommitteeRequestForm.tsx`
  - `apps/frontend/src/app/committees/requests/RequestCard.tsx`
- Include tests that are resilient to text/copy tweaks by asserting key semantics and callback behavior.
