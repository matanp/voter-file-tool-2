# 1.R.11 Admin GET Data Hook Standardization (P3)

**Status:** Resolved
**Priority:** P3 — Low
**Effort:** 0.5–1 day
**Depends on:** [IA-01 Admin IA v1 spec](IA-01-admin-ia-v1-spec.md)

## Summary

Admin read flows are inconsistent: some pages use direct `fetch`, while mutation flows use shared hooks. `TermsManagement` currently has improved error handling but still lacks a standardized GET data hook pattern for loading, retry, and error behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Define a shared GET data-fetch pattern for admin pages (`useSWR`, `useApiQuery`, or equivalent).
- [x] Migrate `TermsManagement` term list fetch to that shared pattern.
- [x] Ensure consistent UI states for loading, error, and retry.
- [x] Add at least one focused test for hook/page behavior (error and success path).
- [x] Add brief docs for when to use the shared GET hook vs mutation hook.

## Implementation Notes

- Scope is standardization, not feature changes.
- Keep initial adoption narrow (Terms page) and extensible to other admin views.
