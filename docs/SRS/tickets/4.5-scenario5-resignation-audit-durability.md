# 4.5 Scenario 5: Resignation Audit Durability + Reason Capture

**Status:** Open  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)  
**Effort:** 2-4 days  
**Depends on:** [2.3 Resignation Workflow](2.3-resignation-workflow.md), [2.5 Structured Removal with Reasons](2.5-structured-removal-reasons.md), [1.5 Audit Trail Infrastructure](1.5-audit-trail-infrastructure.md)

## Summary

Make resignation/removal audit behavior durable and preserve full reason context required for defensibility.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Audit Durability

- [ ] Resignation/removal mutations and their audit writes are handled under a documented durability policy:
  - transactional write (mutation fails if audit insert fails), or
  - explicit durable retry/dead-letter path with operator visibility.
- [ ] The chosen policy is implemented for `/api/committee/remove` and any route that confirms membership removals.
- [ ] Silent audit failure in compliance-critical membership mutations is eliminated.

### Reason + Notes Capture

- [ ] Validation schema includes structured resignation reason (`resignationReason` or mapped `RemovalReason`) per product rule.
- [ ] Resignation reason is persisted in membership/removal records and included in audit payload.
- [ ] Optional operator notes are preserved in audit `afterValue` (or metadata) when provided.

### Tests

- [ ] Route tests verify mutation failure behavior when audit write fails under chosen policy.
- [ ] Route tests verify reason and notes are persisted and audited.
- [ ] Regression test verifies legacy remove flow still works with required reason semantics.
