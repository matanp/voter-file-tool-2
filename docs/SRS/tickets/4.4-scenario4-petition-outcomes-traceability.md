# 4.4 Scenario 4: Petition Outcome Lifecycle + Traceability

**Status:** Open  
**Priority:** P2  
**Effort:** 3-4 days  
**Depends on:** [2.6 Petition + Primary Outcome Tracking](2.6-petition-primary-outcome-tracking.md), [3.4 Vacancy, Changes, and Petition Outcomes Reports UI](3.4-vacancy-changes-petition-reports-ui.md)

## Summary

Resolve petition-lifecycle ambiguity and improve candidate-level traceability in both workspace UX and audit records.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Canonical Petition Status Model

- [ ] `PETITIONED_WON` is either fully implemented or removed; no dead/unused lifecycle enum values remain.
- [ ] Status handling in Prisma schema, petition outcome routes, and report mapping helpers is consistent with the canonical model.
- [ ] Documentation in `docs/SRS` is updated to match implemented lifecycle semantics.

### Candidate-Level Audit Clarity

- [ ] Petition outcome recording emits explicit per-candidate audit metadata containing candidate id, seat number, outcome (`WON|UNOPPOSED|LOST|TIE`), and vote count where provided.
- [ ] Audit trails allow reconstruction of why each petition candidate was or was not activated.

### Workspace Discoverability

- [ ] Committee workspace provides direct navigation to relevant petition outcome context for the selected committee/LTED.
- [ ] Staff can view exclusion context (`lost`, `tie`, etc.) without manually rebuilding filters.

### Tests

- [ ] API tests verify canonical status transitions and report-output consistency for won/lost/tie outcomes.
- [ ] API tests verify per-candidate audit payload shape for all outcome types.
- [ ] UI test verifies committee workspace link-out to filtered petition outcome context.
