# 4.1 Scenario 1: Leader Submission Preflight + Eligibility Snapshot

**Status:** Done  
**Priority:** P1  
**Effort:** 3-5 days  
**Depends on:** [2.1 Eligibility Validation](2.1-eligibility-validation.md), [2.2 Warning System](2.2-warning-system.md), [3.1 Jurisdiction Assignment UI](3.1-jurisdiction-assignment-ui.md)

## Summary

Close Scenario 1 gaps by making required eligibility context visible before submit and wiring explicit preflight checks into leader add/request workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

### UI Context Before Submission

- [x] `AddCommitteeForm` and `CommitteeRequestForm` show an "Eligibility Snapshot" panel before submit with: voter name, voter id, home city/town, home ED, Assembly District, LTED, party, current committee count/capacity, and current warning state.
- [x] Snapshot renders from canonical eligibility response data (no duplicated logic in UI).

### Preflight Validation Behavior

- [x] On candidate selection and LTED/committee selection changes, UI calls `/api/committee/eligibility`.
- [x] Hard stops from preflight disable submit and render actionable messages inline.
- [x] Non-blocking warnings are shown inline but do not block submit.

### Seat Assignment Timing Clarification

- [x] Product behavior is made explicit and implemented consistently:
  - either reserve/assign seat at `SUBMITTED`, or
  - keep seat assignment at activation and update SRS wording accordingly.
- [x] Chosen behavior is documented in `docs/SRS/SRS_v0.1_Committee_Membership_Governance.md` or a linked addendum.

### Tests

- [x] API tests cover preflight responses used by leader UI (hard stop + warning paths).
- [x] Component tests verify submit-button blocking when hard stops exist.
- [x] Regression test verifies Scenario 1 happy path with preflight pass and successful submission.
