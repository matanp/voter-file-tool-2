# 3.1a CommitteeSelector Vacancy/Weight + Empty States

**Status:** Open
**Roadmap:** [SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](../SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) §3.1a
**Effort:** 0.5–1 day
**Depends on:** [2.7 Weight / Designation Logic](2.7-weight-designation-logic.md), [3.1 Jurisdiction Assignment UI](3.1-jurisdiction-assignment-ui.md)

## Summary

Deliver the minimal CommitteeSelector UX contract: vacancy/weight summary block and finalized empty-state copy/placement.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Summary block placement is specified and implemented (single canonical location in selector flow).
- [ ] Vacancy copy variants are standardized (`"Full"`, `"N open seats"`, etc.).
- [ ] Designation weight label/format is standardized; missing weight uses `—`.
- [ ] Empty-state copy is finalized for:
  - no jurisdictions assigned
  - jurisdictions assigned but no committees
- [ ] Spec includes a note that this block/copy must be preserved in future table-based selector redesign.
