# T2.2 AddCommitteeForm Component Tests

**Status:** Open
**Roadmap:** [SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](../SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) Testing Tier 2 §T2.2
**Effort:** 1 day
**Depends on:** [2.1 Eligibility Validation](2.1-eligibility-validation.md), [2.2 Warning System](2.2-warning-system.md)

## Summary

Add coverage for `AddCommitteeForm` to lock in validation and role-based submission behavior before eligibility and warning workflows expand.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Search integration renders and passes selected voter records into form state.
- [ ] Capacity enforcement behavior is tested (disable/guard when committee is full).
- [ ] Duplicate-detection messaging is tested:
  - already in this committee
  - already in another committee
- [ ] Admin direct-add flow is tested.
- [ ] Leader/request flow is tested (submission path and confirmation UX).
- [ ] Loading/disabled states during submit are tested.
- [ ] Server validation error rendering is tested (hard stop and warning payload shapes as applicable).

## Implementation Notes

- **File under test:** `apps/frontend/src/app/committees/AddCommitteeForm.tsx`
- Coordinate expected error copy with `eligibilityMessages` helper behavior.
