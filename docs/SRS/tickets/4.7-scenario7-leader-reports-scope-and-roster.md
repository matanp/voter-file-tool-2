# 4.7 Scenario 7: Leader Reports Scope Hardening + Roster Export

**Status:** Open  
**Priority:** P0/P1  
**Effort:** 3-5 days  
**Depends on:** [3.0a Report Audit](3.0a-report-audit-committee-membership.md), [3.1 Jurisdiction Assignment UI](3.1-jurisdiction-assignment-ui.md), [3.2 Sign-In Sheet Report UI](3.2-sign-in-sheet-report-ui.md), [3.3 Designation Weight Summary Report UI](3.3-designation-weight-summary-report-ui.md)

## Summary

Close Scenario 7 by delivering a leader-safe roster generation path and hardening report authorization/scope enforcement at the API boundary.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Leader Roster Generation

- [ ] Add a leader-accessible "current committee roster" report flow (PDF and/or CSV per approved requirement wording).
- [ ] Roster report is jurisdiction-scoped for leader users and only includes authorized committees.
- [ ] UI exposes this capability from leader workflows without admin-only navigation.

### API Auth + Scope Hardening

- [ ] `/api/generateReport` enforces role/scope restrictions server-side for all report types, including `ldCommittees`.
- [ ] `ldCommittees` is admin-only unless a dedicated jurisdiction-scoped leader variant is introduced.
- [ ] Direct API invocation by leader cannot produce countywide output.

### Requirement/Format Alignment

- [ ] SRS wording is aligned with implemented export formats (PDF/CSV/XLSX as applicable).
- [ ] Report parameter matrix documents final format support per report type.

### Tests

- [ ] API tests verify role/scope boundaries for `ldCommittees` and new roster report flow.
- [ ] UI tests verify leader can generate allowed reports and cannot trigger blocked scopes.
- [ ] Report-generation test verifies output schema/columns for the roster report.
