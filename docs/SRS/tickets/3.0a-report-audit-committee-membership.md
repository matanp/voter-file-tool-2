# 3.0a Audit and Update All Reports for CommitteeMembership

**Status:** Open
**Roadmap:** [SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](../SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) §3.0a
**Effort:** 0.5–1 day
**Depends on:** [3.0 Report-server Migration](3.0-report-server-committee-membership-migration.md)

## Summary

Run a report-by-report audit to ensure no report path depends on legacy committee-membership sources after 3.0. Confirm migration status for each report type and capture any required follow-up work.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create/maintain a per-report checklist with explicit status:
  - `ldCommittees` (migrated in 3.0)
  - `designatedPetition`
  - `voterList`
  - `absenteeReport`
  - `voterImport`
- [ ] For each report, document whether committee membership is used directly, indirectly, or not at all.
- [ ] If a report needs changes, reference the exact file(s) and required update.
- [ ] Confirm no runtime reference to `committeeMemberList` remains in active report-server/report schemas.
- [ ] Add or update tests where audit identifies untested migration-sensitive behavior.
- [ ] Record final audit outcome in this ticket (or linked checklist artifact) with pass/follow-up status.

## Implementation Notes

- This is a migration safety ticket and may include docs + minor code updates.
- The expected code-heavy work is in [3.0](3.0-report-server-committee-membership-migration.md); this ticket closes residual risk.
