# 1.R.8 Phase 1 Remediation Closeout (Tests + Docs) (P1)

**Status:** Resolved
**Priority:** P1 — High
**Effort:** 1–2 days
**Depends on:** [1.R.4 Bulk Import](1.R.4-bulk-import-phase1-incompatible.md), [1.R.5 Source-of-Truth Split](1.R.5-source-of-truth-split.md), [1.R.7 Capacity + Seat Non-Atomic](1.R.7-capacity-seat-assignment-non-atomic.md)

## Summary

Phase 1 foundation is complete, but the remaining unchecked acceptance criteria are spread across 1.R.4, 1.R.5, and 1.R.7. This ticket closes the final testing and documentation work needed to mark those remediation tickets resolved.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Complete 1.R.4 remaining items:
  - Add/update bulk import tests asserting `CommitteeMembership` creation and no `VoterRecord.committeeId` writes.
  - Document migration path for environments where legacy `committeeId` data was populated.
- [x] Complete 1.R.5 remaining item:
  - Update tests (`fetchCommitteeList`, `handleCommitteeDiscrepancy`, report-generation) to assert `CommitteeMembership` as source of truth.
- [x] Complete 1.R.7 remaining items:
  - Add concurrency test where requests exceed capacity and assert exactly `maxSeats` succeed.
  - Document transaction boundaries and isolation assumptions for seat assignment/capacity checks.
- [x] After all above pass, set 1.R.4, 1.R.5, and 1.R.7 to **Resolved**.

## Implementation Notes

- This is a closeout ticket; implementation should modify existing ticket scopes rather than introducing new behavior.
- Keep test updates narrowly focused on proving the intended source-of-truth and atomicity guarantees.
