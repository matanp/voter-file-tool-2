# 3.1 Jurisdiction Assignment UI (Leader Access)

**Status:** Open
**Roadmap:** [SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](../SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) §3.1
**Effort:** 3–5 days
**Depends on:** [1.1 Committee Term Model](1.1-committee-term-model.md), [IA-01 Admin IA v1 spec](IA-01-admin-ia-v1-spec.md)

## Summary

Implement the admin UX for assigning jurisdiction scope to leaders and the user-facing empty states when no scope exists.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Admin page/section supports assigning one or more jurisdictions per leader:
  - user picker (leaders)
  - `cityTown`, optional `legDistrict`, `termId`
  - add/remove assignments
- [ ] Duplicate-assignment prevention in UI and API (same user + term + cityTown + legDistrict).
- [ ] Invite/user-management flow is explicit:
  - whether assignment happens at invite time or post-invite.
- [ ] Leader with no jurisdictions sees a clear empty state and guidance.
- [ ] Leader with jurisdictions but no committees in scope sees a distinct empty state.
