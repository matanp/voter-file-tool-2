# 1.R.20 Admin Flow Audit Coverage (P2)

**Status:** Resolved
**Priority:** P2 — Medium
**Effort:** 0.5–1 day
**Depends on:** [1.5 Audit Trail Infrastructure](1.5-audit-trail-infrastructure.md)

## Summary

Close the remaining Phase 1 code-review audit gap by adding missing audit events in membership-changing admin flows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] In `handleCommitteeDiscrepancy` acceptance/confirmation paths, emit audit events for all membership status transitions.
- [x] In bulk committee import reconciliation, emit audit events for status transitions that activate, remove, or otherwise change membership lifecycle state.
- [x] Audit metadata includes source context:
  - `source: "discrepancy_accept"` for discrepancy flow changes.
  - `source: "bulk_import_sync"` for bulk-sync changes.
- [x] Existing non-blocking audit behavior is preserved (`audit must never block primary mutation`).
- [x] Add tests asserting audit events are attempted with expected action + metadata for both admin flows.

## Implementation Notes

- **Target files:**
  - `apps/frontend/src/app/api/admin/handleCommitteeDiscrepancy/route.ts`
  - `apps/frontend/src/app/api/admin/bulkLoadCommittees/bulkLoadUtils.ts`
  - related tests under `apps/frontend/src/__tests__/api/admin/`
- Keep action enum usage consistent with 1.5 event taxonomy.
