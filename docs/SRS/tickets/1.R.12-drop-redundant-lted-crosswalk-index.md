# 1.R.12 Drop Redundant LTED Crosswalk Index (P3)

**Status:** Open
**Priority:** P3 — Low
**Effort:** 0.5 day
**Depends on:** [1.1b LTED-to-Assembly-District Mapping](1.1b-lted-assembly-district-mapping.md)

## Summary

`LtedDistrictCrosswalk` currently has a non-unique index that duplicates the existing unique index on the same column set. The duplicate index increases write overhead and migration noise without improving query behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create a new forward migration that drops `LtedDistrictCrosswalk_cityTown_legDistrict_electionDistrict_idx`.
- [ ] Verify schema still preserves the unique index/constraint for LTED uniqueness.
- [ ] Confirm key crosswalk lookups (eligibility/joins) retain expected query behavior.
- [ ] Document rationale in migration notes and ticket comments.

## Implementation Notes

- Do not edit historical migration files; use additive forward migration only.
- Validate index names in the current DB before writing the DROP statement.
