# T2.4 Report Generation Forms Tests

**Status:** Open
**Roadmap:** [SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](../SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) Testing Tier 2 §T2.4
**Effort:** 1 day
**Depends on:** [3.2 Sign-In Sheet Report UI](3.2-sign-in-sheet-report-ui.md), [3.3 Designation Weight Summary Report UI](3.3-designation-weight-summary-report-ui.md), [3.4 Vacancy/Changes/Petition Reports UI](3.4-vacancy-changes-petition-reports-ui.md)

## Summary

Add UI-level tests for report generation forms so report-type expansion in Tier 3 does not regress validation, submission, and status feedback behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Existing report forms validate required fields before submit.
- [ ] Form submission triggers expected API call payloads for supported report types.
- [ ] Error states are rendered for failed API responses.
- [ ] Report status tracking UI updates are covered for pending/processing/success/failure states.
- [ ] New Tier 3 report forms are added to tests as they land (sign-in, designation-weight, vacancy/changes/petition outcomes).

## Implementation Notes

- **Primary files under test:**
  - `apps/frontend/src/app/committee-reports/XLSXConfigForm.tsx`
  - `apps/frontend/src/app/petitions/GeneratePetitionForm.tsx`
