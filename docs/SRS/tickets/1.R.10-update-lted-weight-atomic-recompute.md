# 1.R.10 updateLtedWeight Atomicity for Weight Recompute (P2)

**Status:** Resolved
**Priority:** P2 — Medium
**Effort:** 1 day
**Depends on:** [1.4 Seat Model](1.4-seat-model.md)

## Summary

`PATCH /api/committee/updateLtedWeight` updates LTED weight and then recomputes seat weights in a separate step. If recompute fails after the update succeeds, persisted data can become inconsistent. This ticket makes the update + recompute flow atomic.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Refactor `recomputeSeatWeights` to accept a Prisma transaction client (or equivalent transactional execution context).
- [x] Wrap LTED weight update + seat-weight recompute in a single `prisma.$transaction(...)`.
- [x] Ensure recompute failure rolls back the LTED weight update.
- [x] Add/extend tests proving rollback behavior and successful atomic path.
- [x] Document transaction boundaries in route/util comments.

## Implementation Notes

- Keep read/compute/write operations within the same transaction where practical.
- If utility signatures change, update all call sites and tests in the same PR.
