# 4.6 Scenario 6: BOE Flagging Cadence + Stale Resolution

**Status:** Open  
**Priority:** P1  
**Effort:** 3-4 days  
**Depends on:** [2.8 BOE-Driven Automatic Eligibility Flagging](2.8-boe-driven-automatic-eligibility-flagging.md), [4.5 Scenario 5: Resignation Audit Durability + Reason Capture](4.5-scenario5-resignation-audit-durability.md)

## Summary

Tighten BOE eligibility flag operations so queue state reflects current reality, runs are operationally enforced, and confirmed removals remain auditable.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Run Cadence + Orchestration

- [ ] BOE eligibility flagging is triggered after voter imports and on a scheduled recurring run (nightly or documented equivalent).
- [ ] Run scheduling is encoded in job orchestration/config, not manual operator memory.

### Stale Pending Resolution

- [ ] Re-scan logic auto-resolves stale `PENDING` flags when the triggering condition is no longer present.
- [ ] Auto-resolved items are marked with explicit resolution metadata (for example `RESOLVED_BY_RESCAN`) and timestamp.
- [ ] Queue views separate active pending work from auto-resolved historical entries.

### Audit Consistency

- [ ] Confirm-removal decisions from eligibility flags follow the same audit durability policy as Ticket 4.5.
- [ ] Audit entries include flag id, reason, decision, and reviewer/system actor context.

### Tests

- [ ] Processor tests verify stale flag auto-resolution behavior.
- [ ] Integration test verifies scheduled or orchestrated rerun path executes flagging without manual API trigger.
- [ ] API tests verify audit payload completeness for confirm and auto-resolution paths.
