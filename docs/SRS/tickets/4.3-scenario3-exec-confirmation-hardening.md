# 4.3 Scenario 3: Executive Confirmation Approval Hardening

**Status:** Done  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)  
**Effort:** 3-5 days  
**Depends on:** [2.4 Meeting Record + Executive Confirmation Workflow](2.4-meeting-record-confirmation-workflow.md)

## Summary

Enforce meeting-linked executive confirmation as the authoritative approval path and remove workflow bypasses that can activate members without required meeting context.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Approval Path Authority

- [x] `/committees/requests` no longer offers direct `accept` action for production admin flow; UI directs users to `/admin/meetings` for confirmations.
- [x] `/api/committee/handleRequest` rejects `action=accept` without a valid `meetingRecordId`.
- [x] Any activation to `ACTIVE` must persist `meetingRecordId`, `confirmedAt`, and `activatedAt`.

### Lifecycle Consistency

- [x] Membership transitions are consistently recorded as `SUBMITTED -> CONFIRMED -> ACTIVE` for meeting confirmations.
- [x] No route writes `ACTIVE` directly from `SUBMITTED` without recording `confirmedAt`.

### Eligibility Re-check at Decision Time

- [x] `POST /api/admin/meetings/[meetingId]/decisions` re-runs canonical `validateEligibility` before confirming each membership.
- [x] If eligibility fails at decision time, that row is returned as failed and is not activated.

### Tests

- [x] Route tests verify direct-accept without meeting linkage is rejected.
- [x] Bulk decision tests verify changed eligibility between submit-time and meeting-time blocks confirmation.
- [x] Regression test verifies approved records always carry meeting linkage and confirmation timestamps.
