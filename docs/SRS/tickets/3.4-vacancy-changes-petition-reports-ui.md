# 3.4 Vacancy, Changes, and Petition Outcomes Reports UI

**Status:** Open
**Roadmap:** [SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](../SRS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) §3.4
**Effort:** 2–3 days
**Depends on:** [2.6 Petition + Primary Outcome Tracking](2.6-petition-primary-outcome-tracking.md), [3.2 Sign-In Sheet Report UI](3.2-sign-in-sheet-report-ui.md)

## Summary

Add the remaining roadmap report types to report UI and finalize a single parameter/access matrix for all new report workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add report options:
  - `Vacancy Report`
  - `Changes Report`
  - `Petition Outcomes Report`
- [ ] Define and implement per-report parameter contracts (date range, term, jurisdiction filters, defaults).
- [ ] Role behavior is explicit and consistent (admin countywide vs leader scoped).
- [ ] Report labels and descriptions are consistent across UI surfaces.
- [ ] Publish a report UI matrix in docs linking report type -> params -> defaults -> role scope.
