# User Testing Feedback Report

## Voter File Tool - User Experience Issues & Recommendations

_Generated from user testing session feedback_

---

## Executive Summary

This document consolidates user testing feedback for the Voter File Tool application. The feedback reveals several critical usability issues across search functionality, navigation, data validation, and UI design that need immediate attention to improve user experience and application reliability.

---

## Critical Issues (High Priority)

### 1. **City/Town Search Data Integrity Issue**

**Issue**: Brighton search returns only 28 records when it should return significantly more

- **Impact**: Users cannot find voters in Brighton, suggesting data mapping or filtering problems
- **Severity**: Critical - data integrity concern
- **Recommendation**:
  - Audit city/town mapping logic in `CITY_TOWN_CONFIG`
  - Verify Brighton data exists in voter records
  - Check if Brighton is being filtered out by town code logic

### 2. **Browser Navigation State Loss**

**Issue**: Browser navigation (back/forward) clears search state when navigating to record export

- **Impact**: Users lose their search context when navigating between pages
- **Severity**: High - disrupts user workflow
- **Recommendation**: Implement persistent search state management using URL parameters or session storage

---

## Usability Issues (Medium Priority)

### 4. **Search Submission Feedback**

**Issue**: Not clear when a search has been submitted - users need to scroll down to see results

- **Impact**: Users are unsure if their search executed successfully
- **Severity**: Medium - affects user confidence
- **Recommendation**:
  - Add loading indicators during search
  - Show "Search submitted" confirmation message
  - Auto-scroll to results or show results count in header

### 5. **Random Result Ordering**

**Issue**: Search results appear in random order instead of being alphabetized

- **Impact**: Users cannot easily find specific voters in results
- **Severity**: Medium - affects usability
- **Recommendation**:
  - Default to alphabetical sorting by name
  - Add sorting options (name, address, party, etc.)
  - Implement consistent default sorting

### 6. **Field Selection UI Design**

**Issue**: Field Selection header is collapsible but looks identical to non-collapsible headers

- **Impact**: Users don't realize they can expand/collapse the section
- **Severity**: Medium - discoverability issue
- **Recommendation**:
  - Add visual indicators (chevron icons, different styling)
  - Use consistent accordion design patterns
  - Consider making custom field names open by default

---

## Data Validation & Input Issues (Medium Priority)

### 7. **Voter ID Field Validation**

**Issue**: Voter ID field allows text characters when it should only accept numbers

- **Impact**: Users can enter invalid voter IDs, leading to failed searches
- **Severity**: Medium - data integrity
- **Recommendation**:
  - Implement numeric-only input validation
  - Add input formatting (e.g., auto-format as user types)
  - Show clear error messages for invalid input

### 8. **Voter ID Field Length Clarity**

**Issue**: Unclear how many digits the Voter ID field should accept

- **Impact**: Users don't know the expected format
- **Severity**: Medium - usability
- **Recommendation**:
  - Add placeholder text showing expected format (e.g., "Enter 8-digit voter ID")
  - Add help text or tooltip explaining voter ID format
  - Implement character count indicator

### 9. **Search Input & Submit Workflow**

**Issue**: Users want to enter search string and submit simultaneously

- **Impact**: Current workflow requires separate steps for input and submission
- **Severity**: Medium - workflow efficiency
- **Recommendation**:
  - Implement Enter key submission
  - Add "Search as you type" functionality with debouncing
  - Provide keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to submit)

---

## Enhancement Opportunities (Low Priority)

### 10. **Help & Documentation**

**Issue**: Need info button/tooltips with tips and tricks (keyboard shortcuts, etc.)

- **Impact**: Users don't discover advanced features
- **Severity**: Low - feature discoverability
- **Recommendation**:
  - Add help tooltips throughout the interface
  - Create keyboard shortcuts reference
  - Add contextual help for complex fields

### 11. **Election District Input Clarification**

**Issue**: Only "e" is allowed as a text character in the election district field (numbers work fine)

- **Impact**: Users may be confused by the limited text input, though numeric input works correctly
- **Severity**: Low - functional but potentially confusing UX
- **Recommendation**: Consider adding placeholder text or help text to clarify that election districts are typically numeric

### 12. **Unified Fields Documentation**

**Issue**: Need explanatory text under "unified fields" section

- **Impact**: Users don't understand what unified fields are
- **Severity**: Low - feature understanding
- **Recommendation**:
  - Add descriptive text explaining unified field concept
  - Provide examples of how unified fields work
  - Link to documentation or help section

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Current Architecture Context

Based on codebase analysis, the application uses:

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Search**: Complex search state management with `useSearchState` hook
- **Field Configuration**: Centralized field definitions in `SEARCH_FIELDS` constant
- **City/Town Logic**: Hardcoded mapping in `CITY_TOWN_CONFIG`

### Recommended Implementation Approach

1. **Immediate Fixes**: Address critical bugs (election district input, Brighton data)
2. **State Management**: Implement URL-based search state persistence
3. **UI Improvements**: Enhance accordion design and add loading states
4. **Validation**: Add comprehensive input validation with user feedback
5. **Documentation**: Create contextual help system

---

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize Critical Issues**: Focus on election district bug and Brighton data integrity
2. **User Testing Follow-up**: Re-test after critical fixes are implemented
3. **Design System Updates**: Standardize accordion and form component patterns
4. **Documentation**: Create user guide with keyboard shortcuts and field explanations
5. **Performance**: Consider implementing search result caching for better UX
