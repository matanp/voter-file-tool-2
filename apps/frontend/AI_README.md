# AI-Generated README: Frontend

This README was generated by an AI assistant to provide an overview of the frontend application for the `voter-file-tool` project.

## Overview

This is a Next.js application that serves as the primary user interface for the voter file tool. It allows users to search, view, and manage voter data, as well as interact with political committee information.

## Technology Stack

-   **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
-   **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   **UI Library:** [React](https://reactjs.org/)
-   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [shadcn/ui](https.ui.shadcn.com) components
-   **Database ORM:** [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
-   **Authentication:** [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) (with Google Provider)
-   **State Management:** React Hooks and Context API
-   **Deployment:** [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Key Features

-   **Voter Record Search:** A comprehensive search interface to filter voter records by various criteria like name, address, party, and election districts.
-   **Detailed Voter View:** A dedicated page to show detailed information for a single voter, including their voting history.
-   **Committee Management:** Functionality to view and manage political committee lists, which are groups of voters in specific election districts.
-   **Committee Change Requests:** A system for users to request that a voter be added to or removed from a committee.
-   **User Authentication:** Secure user login and session management using NextAuth.js. The application supports different privilege levels (e.g., Admin, Read Access) to control access to features.
-   **Petition Generation (In-progress):** The UI and logic to support generating designating petitions for candidates.

## Project Structure

-   `src/app/`: The main application directory, following the Next.js App Router structure.
    -   `src/app/api/`: API routes for handling backend logic.
    -   `src/app/components/`: Shared React components used across the application.
    -   `src/app/(pages)/`: Different pages of the application, such as `recordsearch`, `committees`, etc.
-   `src/lib/`: Utility functions, Prisma client instance, and other shared libraries.
-   `src/components/`: UI components, including those generated by `shadcn/ui`.
-   `prisma/`: Contains the Prisma schema (`schema.prisma`) and database migrations.
-   `public/`: Static assets.
-   `data/`: Contains raw data files, likely used for seeding the database or for reference.

## Data Model (`prisma/schema.prisma`)

The heart of the application is its data model, defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`. It defines the structure of the PostgreSQL database. Key models include:

-   `User`: Stores user information and privilege levels.
-   `VoterRecord`: The central table holding all information about a voter.
-   `VotingHistoryRecord`: Stores the voting history for each voter, linked to `VoterRecord`.
-   `CommitteeList`: Defines a committee based on a specific location (city/town, legislative district, and election district).
-   `CommitteeRequest`: Tracks user requests to add or remove members from a committee.
-   `DropdownLists`: Stores predefined values for UI dropdowns to ensure consistency in search filters.

## Getting Started

For full local dev (database, R2, report-server, frontend), see [docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md](../../docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md). Required env vars are listed in [.env.example](.env.example).

1.  Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
2.  Set up your `.env` file with the required environment variables (database URL, auth secrets).
3.  Run database migrations: `pnpm db_migrate`
4.  Start the development server: `pnpm dev`
